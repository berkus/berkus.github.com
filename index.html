        <h3>How this page came to existence</h3>

<p>A recent trip into the git land left me wondering how fast things change. About a year ago I was a major proponent of bzr and its much better repository model in my mind. Fast forward to this day and I find git elegant, slick, fast (especially fast - my bzr repository started to crawl after about 1900 commits).</p>

<p>Then a miraculous thing like github is something you don't give up lightly. Launchpad is an over engineered piece of crud - it might suit Canonical guys to work on a large Ubuntu project, but for anything smaller it's just not suitable. GitHub on the other hand has all the bells and whistles in a nice slim package which doesn't get in the way - something I want to have everywhere.</p>

<h3>What I'm working on and why</h3>

<p>My biggest project so far is Metta - a humane, social and multimedia OS. While multimedia and social are pretty much all over the place, humane part is still unexplored widely.</p>

<p>Bits and pieces are appearing in different systems from different vendors, but they still haven't integrated enough.</p>

<ul>
<li>A user interface that helps and optimizes workflows, rather than gets in the way.</li>
<li>A scalable system that works across all your devices - laptops, smartphones, TVs - without the need to explicitly manage every single file, address book record or configuration setting.</li>
<li>An environment that doesn't only passively executes your direct commands, but a living federation of agents working on your behalf to bring you the best and most interesting things you wouldn't even find yourself - something much more useful than idly browsing through 9gag.</li>
<li>Something that could become your actual exocortex device, after some sufficient advances in neural interfacing development.</li>
</ul><p>This is a huge undertaking and given that neither Apple nor Microsoft is near achieving it yet, chances are  I won't make it alone either. But I have to try anyway.</p>

<p>One side - the low-level platform, which supports secure, distributed, federated, peer-to-peer systems - is being developed at <a href="https://github.com/berkus/metta">https://github.com/berkus/metta</a>. It supports an entirely different programming paradigm of component-based composable system, where interfaces between components make it possible to remote parts of the system without ever changing the application itself; and introspection facilities allow to build mashable applications out of existing components without ever needing anything else. A fast, portable, peer-to-peer foundation platform.</p>

<p>Another side - the user-space interaction and social facilities - developed at <a href="https://github.com/berkus/metta-grabber">https://github.com/berkus/metta-grabber</a>. The grabber part in the name comes from "Omnia mea mecum porto" - grab, snapshot things I need and forever keep them available to me. This is one of the current research topics in the humane part. How much data do I need? Where do I need it? How my life changes if I always can find what I need, wherever I am? This project is no less ambitious, but better progress is being made here, since it is a simple application ran on regular off-the-shelf operating systems.</p>
