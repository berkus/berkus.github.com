Fast forward to this day and I find git elegant, slick, fast (especially fast - my bzr repository started to crawl after about 1900 commits).\r\n\r\nThen a miraculous thing like github is something you don't give up lightly. Launchpad is an over engineered piece of crud - it might suit Canonical guys to work on a large Ubuntu project, but for anything smaller it's just not suitable. GitHub on the other hand has all the bells and whistles and in a nice slim package which doesn't get in the way - something I want to have everywhere.\r\n\r\n### What I'm working on and why.\r\nMy biggest project so far is Metta - a humane, social and multimedia OS. While multimedia and social are pretty much all over the place, humane part is still unexplored widely.\r\n\r\nBits and pieces are appearing in different systems from different vendors, but they still haven't integrated enough.\r\n  - A user interface that helps and optimizes workflows, rather than gets in the way.\r\n  - A scalable system that works across all your devices - laptops, smartphones, TVs - without the need to explicitly manage every single file, address book record or configuration setting.\r\n  - An environment that doesn't only passively executes your direct commands, but a living federation of various agents working on your behalf to bring you the best and most interesting things you wouldn't even find yourself - something much more useful than idly browsing through 9gag.\r\n  - Something that could become your actual exocortex device, after some sufficient advances in neural interfacing development.\r\n\r\nThis is a huge undertaking and given that neither Apple nor Microsoft is near achieving it yet, chances are  I won't make it alone either. But I have to try anyway.\r\n\r\nOne side - the low-level platform, which supports secure, distributed, federated, peer-to-peer systems - is being developed at https://github.com/berkus/metta. It supports an entirely different programming paradigm of component-based composable system, where interfaces between components make it possible to remote parts of the system without ever changing the application itself; and introspection facilities allow to build mashable applications out of existing components without ever needing anything else. A fast, portable, peer-to-peer foundation platform.\r\n\r\nAnother side - the user-space interaction and social facilities - developed at https://github.com/berkus/metta-grabber. The grabber part in the name comes from \"Omnia mea mecum porto\" - grab, snapshot things I need and forever keep them available to me. This is one of the current research topics in the humane part. How much data do I need? Where do I need it? How my life changes if I always can find what I need, wherever I am? This project is no less ambitious, but better progress is being made here, since it is a simple application ran on regular off-the-shelf operating systems.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nPing @berkus if you have any questions or ideas.\r\n\r\nBe free!","name":"Exocortex","tagline":"scribbling for singularity","google":"UA-36158006-1"}
