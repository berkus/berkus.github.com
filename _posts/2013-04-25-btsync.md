[Here's a new technology from BitTorrent](http://labs.bittorrent.com/experiments/sync.html) that might be bad news because I'm working on about the same features in MettaNode and at the same time might be good news because my implementation is going to be open source from the start, and I still plan to use less of so-called servers in the infrastructure. But for the much loved p2p world it's absolutely awesome, *gone to install and play with it*.

Eat this, you cloud!
