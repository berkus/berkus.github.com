I've moved things from tumblr to github. It is not finished yet (tags remain unavailable, for example), but majority of things work and I like the github's approach to managing the content - I can write whatever I want and then simply git push it to the blog. Magic!

I also made a landing page at [blog.exquance.com](http://blog.exquance.com) more verbose, not just a list of post. Hope better it conveys what I want to achieve and why this blog is here.

Now I'm off to fix some mettanode regserver issues (you can keep track of mettanode plans [here](https://github.com/berkus/metta-grabber/blob/master/ui/doc/TODO)).
