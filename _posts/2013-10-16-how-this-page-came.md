### How this page came to existence
A recent trip into the git land left me wondering how fast things change. About a year ago I was a major proponent of bzr and its much better repository model in my mind. Fast forward to this day and I find git elegant, slick, fast (especially fast - my bzr repository started to crawl after about 1900 commits).

Then a miraculous thing like github is something you don't give up lightly. Launchpad is an over engineered piece of crud - it might suit Canonical guys to work on a large Ubuntu project, but for anything smaller it's just not suitable. GitHub on the other hand has all the bells and whistles in a nice slim package which doesn't get in the way - something I want to have everywhere.
