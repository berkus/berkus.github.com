In the mean time, I'm slowly rewriting Bryan Ford's SST (Structured Streams Transport) library, using modern C++ and boost.asio, in the hopes that it will be easier to port to Metta. I called it libssu (Structured Streams Unleashed).

As this work progresses I also plan to enter the description of this protocol into an RFC document, so there will be some reference point for alternative implementations. Current progress is available in [features/ssu](https://github.com/berkus/mettanode/tree/feature/ssu) branch on github. When it is functionally on par with existing sst, it will be merged to develop and further mettanode development will be built around this implementation.

I'd like to take the chance to thank Aldrin D'Souza for his excellent [C++ wrapper around openssl crypto functions](http://aldrin.co/crypto-primitives.html). He kindly licensed it for free use under BSD License.
