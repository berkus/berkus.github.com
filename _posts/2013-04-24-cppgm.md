New compilers course, this time in implementing the entire C++11 compiler from scratch by the standard. Really exciting excercise if you want to learn how compilers work, how to implement standards-compliant stuff. And all in all amazingly good training for my getting rusty C++ skills.

[Check here](http://cppgm.org) and sign up for next year's round.

Another excercise in the next post.
