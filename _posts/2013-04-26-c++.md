New C++ is like a totally new language, a lot of new and interesting stuff, like universal initializer syntax (which is not entirely universal), finally a memory model with threads, concurrent accesses, atomics and all things so dearly missed for the past ten years.

And on top of that - a wonderfully fast adoption by the compilers. Within 2 years of standard publication msvc, g++ and clang are close to implementing every new bit of the it. Clang, for example, [supports all the relevant bits of c++11](http://clang.llvm.org/cxx_status.html) and also began supporting features from the upcoming c++1y.

To the proclaimers of C++ death - it's alive and kicking, more than ever, and doing it fast and in style.
