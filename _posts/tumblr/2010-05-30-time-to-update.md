I did a little cleanup on my sites, so my private blog moves over to tumblr,
which is excellent in all imaginable ways. Also means less load on my poor co-
located server box in desperate need of an upgrade.

Not promising any more often updates here, my blog updates are as rare as
spice worm. More often you can see me chit-chatting on
[twitter](http://twitter.com/berkus).

What I would like to promise is more in-depth articles here, as I'm deep
diving into several fascinating areas, like OSdev, board games and programming
languages theory.
