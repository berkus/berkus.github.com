title: CS373 homework 5
---
Homework 5 done. Don't know the grades yet, but it was pretty fun practical
experience.

I love this course a lot more than introduction to AI, but credit where credit
is due - Thrun and Norvig did an amazing job in Intro to AI to prepare me for
this class, I certainly believe this is due to their previous class that I
feel this class is so easy.

With the material provided I'm basically ready to build a small self-
navigating robot, so I hope my Pololu 3pi will get some use soon.
