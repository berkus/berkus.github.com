I've just "invested" my hard earned €20 into something I believe is very
remarkable. [The Album](http://the-album.cc). Leonard, known as "paniq" to
some, is creating very fluent, vibrant music. You can download it [at his
site](http://www.paniq.cc/). "Neurons: Fire at Will" is recommended for
listening, as well as other musical excercises.

What makes it worth this investment is that I know Leonard CAN DO. He does
interesting stuff in open source musical space, and he "open sources" his
music under Creative Commons license as well. Why it's remarkable? Because
it's damn good music! The quality, the vibe, the creativity is very high.
Remarkable.

Another thing worth mentioning, is that he is 25% into the pledge run, and
have already accumulated 59% of the required sum, so if you have a spare euro
or more, just donate them to this exciting project - the bonuses include daily
video log from production studio and special features for top contributors
plus a totally free library of samples, loops, tracks and other sound material
for da real fun(k)!

You can use the Pledgie widget on The Album site, or just PayPal moneys
directly to paniq@paniq.org
