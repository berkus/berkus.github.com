Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception is so far the best game of the whole trilogy. With just enough puzzling, action, cinematics mixed in a very well measured proportion the game keeps player engaged from the first flashback to the last screenful of pixels. There's love, horror, friendship and betrayals, like in a good novel. Amazing graphics will make you want stay around forever and look at the desert sands, wonderfully formidable ocean waters or pillars and towers of Iram. And once you've found all the treasures in the single player campaign, there's absolutely phenomenal multiplayer - you will have to try each mode at least once, they all are an amazing experience and a lot of fun with friends and foes alike.

Highly recommended.
