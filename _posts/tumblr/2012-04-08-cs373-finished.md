I'm done with CS373, having implemented some quite nice algorithms that can be used to real-life robot navigation and after a surprisingly well done final exam (my hopes weren't so high after the AI class, so I'm positively surprised).

It was so fun I signed up for two more classes starting April 16. - Applied Cryptography and Design of Computer Programs. Can't wait to have moar edjuukation.
