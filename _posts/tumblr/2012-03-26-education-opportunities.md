One chat started talking about various online education opportunities. Here's a short summary of the available options, for reference.

First, of course, is [http://www.khanacademy.org/](http://www.khanacademy.org/) - a set of online lectures about many many many different subjects.

A free, live machine learning course from Caltech in U.S.: [http://www.work.caltech.edu/telecourse.html](http://www.work.caltech.edu/telecourse.html) (thanks to Brad for pointing this one out). Note at the bottom of the page the different start times depending on location.

Also MIT video lectures on various subjects, see the whole list here: [http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/) (thanks to Dennis).

[https://www.coursera.org/](https://www.coursera.org/) is a company set up by Andrew Ng and Daphne Koller for providing free online education. They have a selection of great free courses already running and more is coming this year.

[http://www.udacity.com/](http://www.udacity.com/) is a company set up by Sebastian Thrun (of google self-driving car and Intro to AI classes fame) for providing free stanford-grade education online. I'm in cs373 and totally enjoying it.

(Both these are less of "just lectures" and more of the interactive study class approach)
