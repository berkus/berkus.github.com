I took three more classes (actually, I took a lot more this time, but they all fell off, still hope to at least watch the videos).

So here's the breakdown:

[Udacity CS212](http://www.udacity.com/course/cs212) - Design of Computer Programs - a bit boring for me, I usually do all the same stuff as my daily job. Might be interesting to people new in the craft.

[Udacity CS387](http://www.udacity.com/course/cs387) - Applied Cryptography - very interesting one, enjoying the theory and application equally.

[Coursera Compilers](http://coursera.org/compilers) - Compilers (ha!) - extremely interesting, very practical and exciting course. I'm kinda skipping the quizzes - they are too theoretical and not very interesting, but spend most of my time on actually implementing the lexer and parser and in the future hopefully some code generation and optimizations as well. So far, my favourite course.
