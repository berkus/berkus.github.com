> Say hello to mechanically separated chicken. It's what all fast-food chicken is made from - things like chicken nuggets and patties. Also, the processed frozen chicken in the stores is made from it.
> Basically, the entire chicken is smashed and pressed through a sieve - bones, eyes, guts, and all. it comes out looking like this.
> There's more: because it's crawling with bacteria, it will be washed with ammonia, soaked in it, actually. Then, because it tastes gross, it will be reflavored artificially. Then, because it is weirdly pink, it will be dyed with artificial color.
> But, hey, at least it tastes good, right?
> High five, America!
> *smack*
